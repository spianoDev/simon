My take on the classic game.

I decided to tackle this in phases:

Phase 1:
Functionality... 
Create a game board, make the buttons work, add sound and a visual response when buttons are clicked.

Phase 2: 
Programming the computer to create a random pattern with the buttons

Phase 3:
Allowing for turn taking so the computer generates patterns and the user (player) copies them.
This phase will also have a set number of patterns that will determine a "win" case, as well as a "lose" case for
 users unable to recreate the computer pattern.
 
Phase 4: 
Style the game so it looks awesome!

Extensions:
Add scoring and levels
